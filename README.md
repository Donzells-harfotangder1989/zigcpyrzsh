Just walked out, head full of explosions that aren’t explosions — realized halfway through, dream layers on dream layers. Cobb holding onto those spinning tops like a late-night snack he shouldn’t have, but really it was me clutching popcorn remnants in my lap. God, is this what caffeine feels like injected directly into the brain? Back aching from these theater seats; they’re like sitting on bricks disguised as cinema luxury.

>Are those kids real or figments? Feels like I can’t trust my own memories now. Everything felt both hyper-clear and muddy, like trying to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   through rain-streaked windows. The noise — incessant, like some symphony trapped inside a warehouse. Hans Zimmer or maybe Beethoven dismantled and reconstructed with power tools.

The zero-gravity fight scene — jumped right out at me like a cat in a bathtub, completely weightless. That hallway flipping like a pancake, Joseph Gordon-Levitt smothered in syrupy grace. Man, if my mind’s really like two mirrors facing each other, this   might be both the glass and the infinity.

Someone behind me was whispering about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , missing half the suspense. Like, really dude? Spend a few bucks, let your brain get mashed up right. That whole thing with Mal — gotta say, she’s like that dream you’re always just on the edge of remembering, just that inch outside your grasp, like I am with finding proper seating in here.

Dom Cobb and his layers, his tragic sandwich of dreams — started thinking about sandwiches in here, too. I can't remember if I already had lunch, or if my appetite's just projected. God, it hurt my brain! Maybe why someone said they were gonna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again. Can’t blame them, right? So many breadcrumbs scattered across plot and seats.

> Is it bad I sort of wanted the top to stop spinning right there in the theater? Probably a philosophical copout, but my god, my brain needed a break. Got up too quickly, head still spinning; I swear someone’s gonna find a toothbrush under these seats before my thoughts unscramble.

Did I even brush my teeth today? See, Cobb would know, he keeps it all cataloged except emotions messing everything up. Nolan inside my head, what’s he doing there? Too much, too fast, just like when you forget strings in your code. Speaking of, someone pasted this here by mistake:

```csharp
public static void main(Void[] dreamLayers) {
    Dream withinDream = new Dream();
    while(reality == false) {
        spinTop();
        if(falls) break;
    }
}
```

Yeah, someone really screwed up. Or maybe that was me.
